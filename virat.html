    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
    Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi, India. From a very young age,
    he showed strong interest and discipline in cricket. His father supported his
    training and enrolled him in a professional cricket academy. Kohli quickly rose
    through junior cricket because of his technique, confidence, and hunger to score runs.
    </p>

    <p>
    He first gained major attention when he captained India to victory in the
    Under-19 World Cup. Soon after, he entered international cricket and built a
    reputation as one of the most consistent and mentally strong batsmen in the world.
    He later became captain of India across formats and is known for his fitness culture,
    aggressive mindset, and match-winning performances.

    proving his ability outside the subcontinent. Over the years, he became the backbone
    of India’s batting lineup in run chases.

    fitness-first approach. Under his leadership, India stayed at the top of Test rankings
    for a long period. He is also one of the most successful captains in franchise T20 cricket
    and has been the face of Royal Challengers Bengaluru for many seasons.
